We propose a development of a software user toolkit aimed to facilitate the creation of highly usable and effective presentations of mathematical ideas. In this paper we identify three problems which readers of math documents usually experience, and give a vision of how we might address those problems by designing a more interactive and intelligent interface},

 abstract = {This paper presents a simple and widely applicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective type, i.e. hypotheses are rejected one at a time until no further rejections can be done. It is shown that the test has a prescribed level of significance protection against error of the first kind for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties of the test and a number of possible applications are also discussed.},
