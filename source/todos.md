1. Can we run a "replication" study to show that we are capable of reproducing the formulas from the math augmentation paper? Perhaps for each formula, we track whether we can precisely replicate it, or whether we can ``in spirit'' replicate it (i.e., if the labels can't be precisely aligned, but the same labels can be assigned?)
