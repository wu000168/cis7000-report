\section{Conclusion}

\zed{Our controlled lab study yielded two results. First, in complex editing tasks, FFL led to faster and easier editing of augmentation markup compared to a LaTeX baseline, while yielding more readable markup. Second, for simpler tasks where authors wrote simple augmentations from scratch, we observed no significant differences between FFL and the baseline.}
Our study offers signs that FFL reduces viscosity, hard mental operations, and error proneness, while supporting closeness of mapping and progressive evaluation. This paper demonstrates the potential of tools like FFL that extend authoring environments to support the practice of augmenting notation. We hope tools like FFL bring about more pervasive authoring of approachable explanations of math notation.
