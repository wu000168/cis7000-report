% Guidelines for references:
% * Don't show 'n.d.' if there's no date
% * Include all authors' full names
% * Proceedings format: Names. Title. Venue, publisher (Year). Pages.
% * Journal format: Names. Title. Journal Volume Issue (Year), Pages. [Publisher can sometimes be left out if already included in the journal name.]
% * Online attributed: Author. Title. URL.
% * Online non-attributed: Title. URL.
%
% Checks to perform:
% * Are author names correct?
% * Are conference names consistent?
% * Are page numbers right?
% * Are years correct?
% * Is the title correct, with the right casing?
%
% Guidelines relevant to specific types of documents:
% - Articles
%   - Often the publisher is not needed in the reference because it already appears in the name of the journal (e.g., "ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction")
% - Online
%   - Online sources should generally use "online" (and not "misc")
%   - The listing should include an author and a 'urlyear' or date or urldate
% - "Tool"
%   - This bibliography file uses the convention of the "tool:" citation key prefix for
%     entries meant to be referenced as an existing tool, and not as a publication about
%     that tool.
%   - Each tool should have a 'title' and a 'urlyear'.
%
% Entries should be sorted, formatted, and de-duplicated using
